# Startup Expansion Analysis (Power BI & Python)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes startup performance data to support strategic expansion decisions across U.S. states and sales regions.  
It combines data preprocessing in Python with an interactive Power BI dashboard to evaluate revenue, profit, and marketing efficiency.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Power Query
- DAX
- Excel

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- State and City
- Sales Region
- Store ID
- Revenue
- Profit
- Marketing Spend
- Expansion Type (New / Old)

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Revenue distribution by state and sales region
- Revenue share by sales region
- Total KPIs: Revenue, Profit, Marketing Spend
- Marketing spend vs profit by store
- Comparison between new and old expansion locations
- Geographic revenue analysis (Map visualizations)

## 🖼 Dashboard Preview

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Region 2 contributes a higher share of total revenue compared to Region 1
- California and Texas are the top-performing states in terms of revenue
- New expansion locations generate lower revenue compared to established stores
- High marketing spend does not always translate into higher profit
- Certain stores show strong profitability with relatively low marketing spend

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Prioritize expansion in high-performing states such as California and Texas
- Optimize marketing budgets by reallocating spend from low-ROI stores
- Focus on improving profitability in new expansion locations before scaling further
- Replicate strategies from top-performing stores across underperforming regions
- Use region-level performance to guide future market entry decisions
